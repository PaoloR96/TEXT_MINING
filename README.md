Design and development of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot. 
It is an advanced type of chatbot that combines information retrieval techniques and language generation models to provide precise and relevant responses. 
This method allows the chatbot to use a wide range of data sources to create contextual and coherent responses, overcoming the limitations of canned responses.
